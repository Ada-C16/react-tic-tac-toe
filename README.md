# Tic-Tac-Toe: A React App

Hark! A playable version of Tic-Tac-Toe in the browser. View it here: https://lgaetano.github.io/react-tic-tac-toe/

### Game Rules
In Tic-Tac-Toe, the game board is a 3x3 grid of squares.

Each square can be marked with an "X," an "O," or it can remain blank. All squares start blank.

Player "X" and Player "O" take turns marking blank squares. Within the 3x3 grid, if the most recent player turn creates a line of three matching marks (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), then that player wins.

If there are no remaining blank squares and no winner, then the game ends.

We can read more about the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe [in this rules reference](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/tic-tac-toe-game-rules-412170).

## Goal
  
This project demonstrates proficiency in using the React library to build a single page web application, which handles user events, updates the UI and the state of the game.
